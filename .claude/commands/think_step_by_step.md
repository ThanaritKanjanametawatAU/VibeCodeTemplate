Think step-by-step about: $ARGUMENTS

Core analysis:
1. Define the problem precisely
2. List constraints and requirements
3. Generate 2-3 approaches
4. Compare trade-offs
5. Select best approach
6. Plan incremental implementation

For complex problems, think harder about:
- System limitations & scalability
- Security & performance impacts
- Maintenance & future changes
- Edge cases & failure modes

Validate with subagents if needed.
